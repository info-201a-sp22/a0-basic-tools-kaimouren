## Data Viz Summary
The visualization shows the disparity in computer science from 1970 to 2010. It's obvious that the number of males is much larger than females in computer science. The males in this major generally are larger than 75% of total people who award bachelor’s degrees in computer science. Although in the 1980s, the percentage of women in computer science increased and reached the top, it’s still only 37%. It’s necessary to reduce this disparity. But the graph is not good enough because it treated gender as binary. People who are not female or male are not considered so the data is incomplete.

>According to a research report published by the American Association of University Women in 2015, women computer science graduates in the United States peaked in the mid-1980s at 37 percent, and we have seen a steady decline in the years since then to 26 percent today.
